 "The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split. Classes are typically at the level of Make, Model, Year, e.g. 2012 Tesla Model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe." Dataset at [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)


## Over View

You can get images of the dataset `cars_annos.mat` at [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) includes original dataset, training dataset, test dataset.
## Object

*  This repository will help you build up a model that can classify cars found from images taken from traffic cameras.
*  This assignment will involve exploring the importance of the size of a labelled dataset for supervised learning.
